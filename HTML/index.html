<u><h1>Your helpful triangle interprator</h1></u>
  <p>Here is a triangle tracker that tracks different types of triangles based on the measurements a user feeds it.</p>
  <p>It follows the following criteria to idntify the triangles:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
    <li>For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.</li>
    <li>For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.</li>
    <li>Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle <strong>CANNOT be formed using those values</strong>. <em>(For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)</em></li>
        </li>
  </ol>
